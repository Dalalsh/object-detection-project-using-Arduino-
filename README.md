# object-detection-project-using-Arduino-
components used:

1. Arduino Uno 
2. Breadboard
3. DF Player mini
4. Vibration motor
5. jumping wires
6. 2 Ultrasonic sensors
7. 3.5 mm jack audio

Note: The project is implemented using only 2 ultrasonic sensor , you can use one extra sensor at the center( pins 4 and 5 on schematic) as shown in the schematic but few changes should be taken into consideration for the code.
